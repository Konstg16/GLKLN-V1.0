# GLKLN-V1.0

<p><h1>Introduction:</h1></p>
<p>This is 3D printer project.</p>
<p>The printer name is GLKLN version 1.0.</p>
<p>The main idea of this printer is to create a new design of a 3D printer with a cubic cartesian scheme which includes as many as possible parts from plastic. I.e. it supports the RepRap concept to create some kind of easy reproducible 3d printer to make it more achievable for a wide engineer society.</br>
One of the main concepts is that all plastic parts designed to be printed by one hotend 3d printer without using supports.</p>

<p><h1>Main features:</h1></br>
1. Cubic construction – Strong and Stable.</br>
2. Simple construction – The hotbed Z-axes are the part of the construction.</br>
3. The Hotbed can be increased – up to 240mm x 290mm.</br>
4. The Z-axis can be increased – up to 310mm.</br>
5. The belt connection is simple and confident.</br>
6. Almost all parts of construction made of plastic.</p></br>
<p><h1>Content:</h1></br>
